# Infiltrator File Manager

Infiltrator File Manager is a clean-sheet file-management project for InfiltratorOS.

**Current source version:** 0.1.14\
**Shared foundation:** exact Infiltratr Common 1.19.40 gitlink, linked through the full Common target on InfiltratorOS/POSIX\
**Desktop implementation:** C++20 + GTK 4/GIO\
**Status:** early implementation; deterministic browsing and mutation foundation with multi-selection batch transfer, interruption inspection and verified metadata preservation

The project does not exist to reproduce Nemo, Dolphin, Explorer, Finder or another existing file manager. Mature products, standards and current research are evidence. The project chooses the strongest justified mechanisms and owns its own interaction, operation and recovery semantics.

The implementation has now started, but the architecture remains deliberately capable of changing while the early model and interaction contracts are being proven. The first tranches establish a real browser and the mutation boundary before semantic indexing, broad parity features or filesystem-specific policy are allowed to accumulate.

## Design position

Infiltrator File Manager is intended to complement InfiltratorFS while remaining a general-purpose file manager on other filesystems.

The key boundary is:

```text
filesystem exposes capability
        ↓
File Manager discovers and presents capability
        ↓
ordinary fallback remains available elsewhere
```

InfiltratorFS remains authoritative for its persistent format, transactions, allocation, integrity, history and storage policy. File Manager must not parse private InfiltratorFS structures or make ordinary operation depend on InfiltratorFS.

Where stable qualified interfaces exist, InfiltratorFS can enable stronger experiences such as persistent object identity, retained file history, reflink-aware copies, integrity information and richer recovery.

## Product principles

- first-principles engineering rather than competitor imitation;
- navigation, exact search and semantic/contextual retrieval as peer workflows;
- real files and the real filesystem namespace remain authoritative;
- semantic indexes are local, derived and rebuildable;
- deterministic file mutation with explicit failure and verification semantics;
- recovery/reversibility designed with the success path, not after it;
- capability discovery instead of filesystem-name assumptions;
- asynchronous first-paint-oriented UI behaviour;
- progressive disclosure: simple surface, deep capability;
- platform/toolkit details kept below a toolkit-neutral file/object model;
- Common is the canonical first-party substrate for strong product-neutral mechanics rather than a token dependency; and
- Mercedes-Benz-level technical excellence, reliability, effortless interaction and disciplined visual reduction as the execution quality bar.

## Complete intended product surface

The full feature catalogue is maintained in [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md). It covers both mature file-manager parity and the capabilities that make Files an Infiltrator product: deterministic recoverable operations, exact/content/semantic retrieval, contextual activity, first-class InfiltratorFS identity/history/reflinks/integrity, remote/device/archive handling, security, accessibility, performance and qualification.

The catalogue is intentionally broader than the current release. It is the product contract used to plan implementation and to prevent local UI changes from silently becoming architecture.

Common's role is documented separately in [`docs/COMMON-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/COMMON-INTEGRATION.md). That ledger identifies which mechanics Files should inherit from Common, which semantics remain Files-owned, and which capabilities remain InfiltratorFS-owned.

Product-level acceptance is defined in [`docs/PRODUCT-QUALITY.md`](docs/PRODUCT-QUALITY.md). It establishes the golden user journeys, engineering/interaction/aesthetic evidence, proportional-complexity rule and release-quality gate used to decide whether a tranche actually makes Files better for a person.

## Current 0.1.14 implementation

File modification timestamps use one shared temporal policy snapshot for both date and time. Explicit clocks use Common's UI-language-aware renderer: English Chinese-time labels use `Shēn hour` or `Shēn, first half`, Chinese-language labels use native characters, and Roman clocks keep Roman numerals and daylight twelfths with translated wording. Selected non-Gregorian dates use Common's optional bridge to Calendar 1.0.85 or newer for matching UI-language presentation; Calendar owns conversion. An unavailable date provider is shown as unavailable rather than silently displaying a Gregorian date. Locale Gregorian dates retain their native platform formatting. Existing live policy monitoring refreshes the visible labels; sorting continues to use raw filesystem timestamps.

The executable is `infiltrator-file-manager`, presented to the user as **Files**.

It currently provides:

- Home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Computer and Trash entry points;
- Back, Forward and Up navigation;
- an editable location field accepting paths and URIs;
- asynchronous, monitored directory enumeration through GTK/GIO;
- a virtualised GTK 4 list presentation rather than one widget per directory entry;
- shared-model **Detail/List**, **Visual/Icons** and **Compact** browse presentations with common selection and activation semantics;
- an analytical Detail/List presentation with aligned **Name**, **Type**, **Size** and **Date Modified** fields sourced from the same directory metadata model;
- a true Compact dense-scan composition using a small icon beside each filename so multiple readable columns can flow across the window;
- native file/folder icons, Common-formatted file sizes and item count/status;
- directory activation and launching files through the platform's registered default application;
- a toolkit-neutral `Location` model and navigation history beneath the GTK presentation;
- the canonical Infiltrator Day/Night/System design contract from pinned Common;
- a persistent **Follow system / Day / Night** appearance control, with live GTK system-theme tracking when Follow system is selected;
- a real GTK multi-selection model for selecting more than one directory item while preserving the existing single-item action contract when exactly one item is selected;
- deterministic **New Folder**, available from the header action or `Ctrl+Shift+N` for native locations;
- deterministic **Rename**, available from the selected-item Actions menu or `F2` when exactly one item is selected;
- deterministic single-item **Copy to…** and **Move to…**, using a native folder picker for the destination;
- isolated multi-item **Copy selected to…** and **Move selected to…** actions rather than expanding the proven single-item controller into a second state machine;
- full-batch collision preflight before mutation when no batch conflict policy has yet been chosen, so a detected destination conflict does not allow earlier non-conflicting items to be silently transferred first;
- compatible batch-conflict choices for **Skip Conflicts**, **Keep Both** and **Replace Conflicts**, with one selected policy applied consistently to conflicts in that batch;
- per-item durable START/END journal records inside batch operations, so interrupted work remains attributable to individual source/destination mutations;
- aggregate byte/item progress and safe-boundary cancellation for multi-item Copy/Move batches;
- explicit single-item destination-conflict choices for **Skip**, **Keep Both** and **Replace** rather than implicit overwrite behaviour;
- deterministic Keep Both naming such as `name (copy).ext`, `name (copy 2).ext` and subsequent unique names while preserving file extensions;
- explicit **Replace** handling that stages the existing destination rather than deleting it first;
- replacement staging that verifies the replacement, restores the previous destination on a safe failure path and retains staged data rather than guessing after an uncertain move;
- same-filesystem moves through filesystem rename semantics, with copy-then-remove fallback for cross-volume moves;
- recursive directory transfer with symbolic links preserved as links;
- ordinary copy and cross-volume move transfer paths that preserve regular-file and directory permissions and modification timestamps when the destination permits them;
- metadata preservation applied to directories after their children are written so directory modification times are not immediately destroyed by the copy itself;
- explicit verification failure when copied contents exist but supported permission/timestamp metadata could not be preserved, rather than claiming perfect preservation;
- byte and item progress for single-item Copy/Move transfers, surfaced in the header without blocking the GTK main loop;
- explicit transfer cancellation, checked during chunked file copy and directory traversal, with partial copy destinations removed where cleanup is safe;
- cross-volume move cancellation before source removal so cancellation does not silently discard the source;
- deterministic **Move to Trash** for one selected native item, available from the Trash action and the `Delete` key;
- **Restore** from the Trash namespace to the original local path when the platform exposes the original location;
- explicit restore-collision handling with staged replacement rather than deleting the existing destination first;
- explicit **Delete Permanently…**, guarded by a confirmation dialog and available separately from recoverable Trash removal; `Shift+Delete` invokes the permanent path directly;
- a toolkit-neutral ordinary operation engine with explicit preflight, destination planning, execution, post-verification and typed result states;
- a dedicated transfer operation layer for conflict policy, progress accounting, cancellation and qualified metadata preservation rather than enlarging the ordinary operation engine;
- a separate batch-transfer engine that owns multi-source planning and policy while reusing the qualified single-item transfer/recovery layers;
- a separate recovery/destructive operation layer for replacement rollback, Trash, restoration and permanent deletion so destructive policy does not inflate the ordinary operation engine;
- an fsync-backed durable operation journal at the user's XDG state location, with a persisted START record before mutation and END record after the operation result;
- fail-closed journalling for New Folder, Rename, Copy, Move, Keep Both, Replace, Trash, Restore, Permanent Delete and each item in a batch: if the START record cannot be persisted, that mutation is not started;
- startup inspection of journal START records with no matching END from a previous Files session;
- conservative interrupted-operation closure as **verification failure**, never inferred success, while retaining the exact operation kind/source/destination for inspection;
- an explicit warning/inspection surface when interrupted operations are found, including notification if the recovery END itself cannot be persisted;
- journal completion failures surfaced as verification problems instead of silently inventing a durable completed state;
- distinct handling for invalid requests, destination conflicts, permission failures, read-only locations, cancellation, execution failures and verification failures;
- asynchronous execution of mutation work so filesystem operations do not block the GTK main loop;
- monitored refresh and automatic selection of newly created, renamed, copied or moved single items when their result appears in the current view;
- separate creation, single-item operation, batch operation, destructive/recovery, journal-inspection and theme controllers so interaction policy does not accumulate inside `FileManagerWindow`;
- the full `InfiltratrCommon::Common` build dependency on InfiltratorOS/POSIX, making Common's POSIX/state/I/O contracts available to the non-UI layers as they are introduced; and
- a hosted build/test gate on every main-branch update, including batch preflight/policy/progress/cancellation, interrupted-journal recovery and permission/timestamp preservation qualification.

Metadata preservation is deliberately honest in 0.1.14: permissions and modification timestamps are qualified for ordinary copy/cross-volume transfer paths, while ownership, ACLs, extended attributes, sparse-file preservation and symlink metadata remain future capability work. Multi-selection batch Copy/Move is present; destructive batch Trash/Delete is not yet claimed.

The next implementation work continues the richer file/object/capability model and remote-location/provider handling; mounted/removable discovery is already part of the browsing foundation rather than a reason to add ad-hoc controls.

Semantic/context indexing and InfiltratorFS-specific capability providers are also deliberately absent from this early executable. Ordinary file-manager correctness comes first.

## Build

On a Debian-family development system with GTK 4 development files installed:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Infiltrator-Projects/Infiltrator-File-Manager.git
cd Infiltrator-File-Manager
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/infiltrator-file-manager
```

The build rejects a missing, wrong-version or wrong-commit Infiltratr Common checkout. Version 0.1.14 is pinned to Common 1.19.40 at commit `e0cde97b684b6861134be88be5e2126afa11548e`.

## Research conclusion

The evidence reviewed so far does **not** support replacing folders with an AI interface.

It supports a stronger hybrid:

```text
navigation ─┐
exact search ├─→ authoritative file/object model → deterministic operations
semantic    ─┘                         ↓
                                  OS/filesystem
```

Context, semantic retrieval, activity views and related-item discovery can improve re-finding, but they remain derived overlays. The filesystem stays the source of truth.

## Implementation sequence

The implementation proceeds by proving boundaries rather than accumulating visible features:

1. read-only navigation shell and toolkit-neutral location model, with Common used for every applicable product-neutral contract;
2. deterministic mutation/operation engine with explicit failure and verification state;
3. richer file/object/capability model and volume/remote-location handling;
4. mature parity features such as tabs, split view, bookmarks, properties, permissions, thumbnails/previews, archives and batch rename;
5. exact/content search and rebuildable indexing;
6. qualified InfiltratorFS capability provider for persistent identity, native history, reflinks, integrity and stronger recovery;
7. contextual/semantic retrieval as a rebuildable non-authoritative layer; and
8. continued accessibility, performance, visual and interaction refinement against the Common/Infiltrator design contract.

Each tranche must remain useful and testable without making later architectural layers authoritative by accident.

Current browsing foundation also discovers mounted/removable places through GIO and removes their sidebar entries when the platform reports disappearance.
