# Infiltrator File Manager — Complete Feature Catalogue

**Catalogue date:** 6 October 2026  
**Scope:** intended product capability, not only the current 0.1.0 implementation

This document is the authoritative feature catalogue for Infiltrator File Manager (Files). It exists so implementation does not drift into a sequence of locally convenient UI changes. Every substantial feature should map back to one of these product capabilities or cause this catalogue to be deliberately amended.

The catalogue is intentionally broader than a conventional Linux file manager. Files is a clean-sheet InfiltratorOS application designed around the strongest justified behaviour from mature file managers, current HCI/retrieval research, the Infiltrator software family and InfiltratorFS.

This is not a promise that every item ships in the first release. It is the complete intended product surface against which releases can be planned and omissions can be explicit.

## Status vocabulary

- **FOUNDATION** — already present in the initial 0.1.x foundation or required by the architecture now.
- **CORE** — expected ordinary file-manager capability; absence would leave Files incomplete as a general-purpose manager.
- **ADVANCED** — high-value capability beyond minimum parity, intended after the core is qualified.
- **RESEARCH** — direction justified by research but requiring prototype/measurement before the interaction contract is frozen.
- **IFS** — capability that becomes richer on InfiltratorFS but must degrade cleanly elsewhere.
- **DELEGATED** — intentionally handed to another InfiltratorOS product or operating-system service rather than duplicated in Files.

- **CORE** Directory monitoring coalesces storms rather than repainting per raw event.
- **CORE** No O(n²) behaviour in ordinary large-directory selection/sort/update paths.
- **CORE** Memory use bounded for million-entry and large-tree operations.
- **CORE** Search indexes incremental and rebuildable.
- **CORE** Remote/network concurrency bounded.
- **CORE** Copy engine adapts buffering/concurrency based on source/destination characteristics after measurement rather than hard-coded folklore.
- **ADVANCED** Native-build optimisation consistent with InfiltratorOS release policy where measured beneficial.
- **ADVANCED** PGO/LTO release qualification where workload evidence justifies it.
- **CORE** Performance regressions have reproducible benchmarks rather than subjective “feels slow” acceptance.

# 31. Reliability and qualification

- **CORE** Unit tests for toolkit-neutral models.
- **CORE** Operation-engine tests independent of GUI.
- **CORE** Provider contract tests.
- **CORE** Filesystem matrix: InfiltratorFS plus representative ext4/XFS/Btrfs/FAT/exFAT/NTFS and network/provider paths where available.
- **CORE** Unicode/path-length/name-boundary tests.
- **CORE** Permission-denied tests.
- **CORE** Read-only destination tests.
- **CORE** Full-disk/no-space tests.
- **CORE** Source disappears mid-operation.
- **CORE** Destination disappears mid-operation.
- **CORE** Removable device unplug during read/write.
- **CORE** Network disconnect during enumeration/copy.
- **CORE** Application termination during staged copy/move.
- **CORE** Power-loss/durability-oriented qualification for Files-owned journals/state where relevant.
- **CORE** Symlink race/path substitution tests around privileged or destructive operations.
- **CORE** Huge-file and huge-directory tests.
- **CORE** Sparse-file tests.
- **CORE** Reflink/shared-extent tests where supported.
- **IFS** Persistent-ID and history restore qualification against InfiltratorFS.
- **CORE** Accessibility regression checks.
- **CORE** Day/Night/System theme readability checks.
- **CORE** No release marked successful solely because it launches.

# 32. InfiltratorOS integration

- **CORE** Installed as the default file manager only after qualification proves the replacement works.
- **CORE** Desktop launcher/application metadata.
- **CORE** File/folder open handling.
- **CORE** System Settings integration for system-owned preferences rather than duplicate controls.
- **CORE** Common design/temporal policy integration.
- **CORE** Removable-media and mount-service integration.
- **CORE** Notifications only for meaningful long-running/background operation state; avoid notification spam.
- **ADVANCED** System-wide search integration using Files' exact/semantic index through a narrow query interface.
- **ADVANCED** Open/save chooser integration is a separate contract; Files should not assume the main window is an appropriate file chooser.
- **DELEGATED** Desktop shell/panel/window-manager behaviour belongs to the shell/window system.
- **DELEGATED** Desktop icon management should only move into Files if InfiltratorOS explicitly chooses Files as that provider after separate design work.

# 33. User-facing diagnostics and evidence

- **CORE** Failed operation explains what failed, on which object, and what remains complete/incomplete.
- **CORE** “Unknown” is a valid state; do not synthesize misleading values.
- **CORE** Operation details available without forcing every user to read them.
- **ADVANCED** Copyable technical evidence for support/debugging: operation ID, provider, source/destination URIs, error class, completed counts, not secrets.
- **ADVANCED** Optional diagnostic log with bounded retention and privacy controls.
- **CORE** UI messages use human wording while preserving machine-classifiable error state internally.

# 34. Explicit non-features / ownership boundaries

The following are deliberately not general Files responsibilities:

- **DELEGATED** filesystem formatting;
- **DELEGATED** partition-table editing;
- **DELEGATED** defragmentation;
- **DELEGATED** deep scrub/repair administration;
- **DELEGATED** filesystem implementation policy such as block placement/compression decisions;
- **DELEGATED** full backup product;
- **DELEGATED** antivirus engine;
- **DELEGATED** cloud synchronisation engine;
- **DELEGATED** terminal emulator;
- **DELEGATED** text/media/document editor;
- **DELEGATED** desktop environment control centre;
- **DELEGATED** opaque AI agent allowed to mutate the namespace autonomously;
- **DELEGATED** proprietary metadata database required to access ordinary files.

Files may expose links/actions into specialist products and may consume qualified providers, but it should not absorb every adjacent function merely because a file is involved.

# 35. Release sequencing

The intended implementation sequence is deliberately smaller than the catalogue:

1. **Browsing foundation** — location model, async enumeration, views, navigation, devices, launch/open, Common integration.
2. **Deterministic mutation engine** — create/rename/copy/move/trash/delete, collision handling, progress, cancellation, recovery evidence.
3. **Mature file-manager parity** — tabs, split view, bookmarks, properties, permissions, thumbnails/previews, remote locations, archives, batch rename.
4. **Retrieval** — exact/content search, saved searches, activity model.
5. **InfiltratorFS advantage** — identity, native history, reflinks, integrity and stronger recovery through stable capability interfaces.
6. **Research features** — semantic/contextual retrieval and workflow surfaces after prototype and privacy/performance qualification.
7. **Deep polish** — accessibility, performance, PGO where justified, edge-case qualification and interaction refinement.

A feature moves earlier only when it is needed to make an earlier layer correct. Visual novelty alone is not sufficient reason to jump the sequence.
