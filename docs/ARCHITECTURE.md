# Infiltrator File Manager — Initial Architecture

This document defines the initial architectural model derived from the project's design philosophy and October 2026 research review. It is intentionally pre-implementation. Performance measurements, prototypes and further research may change details before code architecture is frozen.

## 1. Architectural boundary

Infiltrator File Manager owns the user-facing model of files, locations, retrieval, operations and recoverability.

It does **not** own filesystem allocation, persistent on-disk structures, filesystem transaction semantics or specialist disk administration. Those remain responsibilities of the operating system and filesystem.

The architecture separates four kinds of truth:

1. **filesystem truth** — the actual namespace, objects, metadata and supported storage semantics;
2. **application model** — File Manager's current representation of locations, objects, capabilities and operations;
3. **derived indexes** — search, semantic and activity/context indexes that can be discarded and rebuilt; and
4. **presentation state** — windows, selection, sorting, layout, expansion and other UI state.

Only the first two may govern file mutation. Derived indexes and presentation state never become authoritative storage.

## 2. Layered model

       remote locations                 qualified extra features

Derived side systems:

filesystem events ──→ exact/content index ──┐
                                            ├─→ retrieval model
filesystem events ──→ semantic/context index┘

Both indexes are rebuildable and non-authoritative.
```

## 3. Core model

The initial model should be expressed in toolkit-neutral concepts rather than GTK objects.

### Location

A browseable namespace endpoint or container context.

Examples:

- local directory;
- mounted volume;
- remote share/location;
- trash;
- search result space;
- history view;
- explicit collection; or
- derived activity/context view.

A derived location does not imply a new filesystem namespace.

### FileObject

Represents one logical item known to the application.

Potential fields include:

- current location/name;
- object kind;
- metadata and availability flags;
- stable identity when available;
- current capability set;
- content type;
- size/logical size/physical size where available;
- timestamps;
- integrity/history indicators where available; and
- source/provider identity.

Unknown and unavailable values remain distinct from zero/empty values.

### CapabilitySet

A per-location or per-object description of supported behaviour.

Candidate capabilities include:

- read/write;
- atomic rename/replace;
- trash/reversible deletion;
- clone/reflink;
- sparse preservation;
- xattrs/named metadata;
- stable object identity;
- historical-version enumeration;
- historical restore;
- integrity status;
- storage-intent hints;
- durable publication guarantees; and
- remote/offline semantics.

The UI should branch primarily on capability, not on string comparisons such as `filesystem == "infiltratorfs"`.

### HistoryEntry

Represents a previous state or recoverable operation in a provider-neutral form.

History sources may include:

- filesystem-retained generations;
- trash;
- application operation journal;
- platform versioning facilities; or
- other qualified providers.

The UI must show where a history item comes from and what restoration means.

### ActivityContext

A derived grouping of files related by user activity, explicit grouping, chronology or other explainable signals.

ActivityContext is never filesystem truth and must not silently move files.

## 4. Identity model

Paths and object identity are deliberately separate.

Preferred identity order:

1. qualified persistent filesystem object identity, where exposed;
2. a platform/filesystem stable identifier with documented lifetime;
3. a compound weaker identity valid only inside a known mount/session; or
4. path-based fallback.

InfiltratorFS persistent 128-bit IDs can provide the strongest form when a stable public capability interface exists.

Derived indexes must record the strength/scope of the identity they rely on. They must tolerate rename, move, remount, replacement and identity invalidation rather than assuming pathname permanence.

## 5. Operation engine

All mutating filesystem actions pass through one deterministic operation engine.

A normal operation has the conceptual phases:

```text
request
   ↓
resolve objects/locations
   ↓
preflight capabilities + conflicts + permissions + space
   ↓
build explicit operation plan
   ↓
execute
   ↓
establish required durability where supported/required
   ↓
post-verify result
   ↓
publish final state + recovery/undo information
```

The engine owns:

- copy;
- move;
- rename;
- replace/overwrite;
- create;
- delete/trash;
- restore;
- batch operations; and
- provider-backed clone/history operations.

Semantic/AI systems may create candidate selections or proposed plans but cannot bypass the operation engine.

### Failure states

At minimum, operations distinguish:

- success;
- partial success;
- cancelled cleanly;
- cancelled with retained partial result;
- permission failure;
- source disappeared/changed;
- destination conflict;
- insufficient space;
- destination disconnected;
- unsupported capability;
- durability could not be established; and
- verification failure.

The UI should not collapse these into a generic "something went wrong" state.

## 6. Recoverability and journal

File Manager should maintain a user-visible operation history sufficient to explain recent mutations and expose reversible actions when they genuinely exist.

The operation journal is not a substitute for filesystem history. It records what File Manager attempted and established.

A journal entry may include:

- action and timestamp;
- source/destination identities and paths;
- capability path used (ordinary copy, reflink, atomic replace, trash, etc.);
- result state;
- verification state; and
- an undo/restore token only where an actual reversible mechanism exists.

The application must never manufacture an Undo button when no reliable reversal exists.

## 7. Search architecture

Search has independent layers:

### Exact/native search

Uses filenames, paths, metadata and optionally indexed content with deterministic query semantics.

### Semantic search

Uses a rebuildable local semantic index. It may index supported document content, metadata and derived context.

Semantic results must preserve:

- source object identity/path;
- confidence/ranking information;
- an explanation or provenance signal where practical; and
- a route back to the actual filesystem object.

Semantic search must degrade to unavailable without affecting ordinary browsing/search.

### Context retrieval

May combine explicit and derived relationships such as:

- same folder;
- recently used together;
- same activity/project;
- related content;
- shared historical lineage; or
- explicit collection membership.

The system should distinguish inferred relationships from user-authored ones.

## 8. InfiltratorFS capability provider

The InfiltratorFS integration is an optional provider behind the same application model.

It may expose qualified capabilities that generic OS APIs cannot represent strongly enough, for example:

- persistent 128-bit object ID;
- retained-generation enumeration;
- object-level historical open/restore when implemented and qualified;
- integrity status;
- richer clone/shared-data information;
- filesystem-specific durable-publication guarantees; and
- versioned storage-intent hints.

The provider must use a stable public interface. File Manager must not parse InfiltratorFS private metadata or on-disk structures.

If the provider is missing or the filesystem is not InfiltratorFS, the same application model uses generic platform capabilities.

## 9. UI execution model

The GUI is first-paint oriented.

Before the first visible frame, only work required to show a useful shell/current location should run synchronously.

The following are asynchronous by default:

- directory enrichment beyond minimum enumeration;
- thumbnail generation;
- content indexing;
- semantic indexing;
- network discovery;
- remote metadata probes;
- history enrichment;
- integrity queries that may block;
- related-item computation; and
- large property aggregation.

Results merge incrementally into visible models using stable identities/generations so late worker results cannot corrupt a newly selected location.

A failed background subsystem must fail open: the normal file manager remains usable.

## 10. Presentation model

The production UI should be selected after prototyping, not inferred directly from current file managers.

The architecture nevertheless assumes several information roles:

- **primary browse/search canvas** — files and containers;
- **navigation context** — hierarchy, history and locations;
- **zero-layer contextual actions** — a restrained set of actions relevant now;
- **detail/inspection surface** — progressively disclosed metadata/capabilities/history;
- **operation surface** — progress, conflicts, errors and recovery; and
- **retrieval mode** — exact and semantic search without losing browse context.

UI concepts must map to the same underlying application model rather than implementing independent file logic per view.

### Browse presentation invariants

Directory view mode is presentation state over one shared browse model. The initial production contract distinguishes three task-oriented presentations: **Detail / analytical**, **Visual**, and **Compact / dense scan**.

The presentation layer may create different GTK/view objects to render those modes efficiently, but it must not duplicate navigation, selection authority, sorting policy, activation behaviour, drag/drop policy, context-action policy or file-operation logic. A switch of presentation must preserve the user's logical selection and current location and must not trigger a filesystem mutation or reinterpret the underlying objects.

View identity is separate from density. A Visual view may support different icon/thumbnail sizes without becoming a different semantic view. Detail may vary row density or columns. Compact remains a distinct multi-column small-icon-plus-label composition rather than a shrunken Visual grid.

The remembered presentation is application-level presentation state. Global persistence across ordinary restart is the baseline. Per-location presentation memory may be layered on later, but must not be required by the browse model and must not create hidden filesystem semantics.

All three presentations must consume the same asynchronous directory data and remain compatible with large-directory virtualisation. Switching presentation should not cause duplicate enumeration or independent metadata pipelines unless measurement proves a view-specific enrichment is required.

## 11. Security and privacy

File content, paths, filenames, metadata, semantic vectors and activity relationships are private user information.

Initial rules:

- local indexing by default;
- no network requirement for normal file operations;
- least-privilege execution;
- privilege elevation only for the narrow action that requires it;
- clear boundary between browsing and destructive/admin actions;
- provider outputs treated as untrusted until validated against contract; and
- no direct semantic-agent filesystem mutation.

## 12. Qualification model

The file manager must be tested against real failure, not only correct local files.

Qualification should eventually include:

- enormous directories;
- deep directory trees;
- long valid UTF-8 names;
- hard links and symlinks;
- sparse files;
- reflink-capable and non-reflink filesystems;
- removable-media removal during enumeration and transfer;
- remote filesystem latency/disconnect/reconnect;
- permission changes during an operation;
- source replacement/rename races;
- low/free-space exhaustion;
- partial copy/move recovery;
- cancel at each operation phase;
- history/restore correctness;
- search-index corruption/rebuild;
- semantic subsystem unavailable/corrupt;
- mixed filesystems in one operation;
- InfiltratorFS history/object identity integration;
- view switching with preserved selection/sort/location state;
- large-directory behaviour in Detail, Visual and Compact presentations;
- narrow-window and Day/Night rendering across presentations; and
- accessibility/keyboard-only workflows.

The success path, failure path and recovery path are all part of the feature.

## 13. Architecture questions deliberately left open

The following must be decided through research/prototyping rather than assumption:

- GTK3, GTK4 or another presentation framework for the initial Linux product;
- exact C/C++ component boundaries;
- exact local semantic embedding/index implementation;
- whether activity contexts are automatic, explicit or hybrid;
- the operation-journal persistence format;
- cross-filesystem move recovery strategy;
- remote filesystem abstraction boundaries;
- plugin/extension model;
- preview/thumbnail sandboxing; and
- exact public InfiltratorFS capability API.
